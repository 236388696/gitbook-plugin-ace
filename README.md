## Syntax

The plugin has a basic syntax:

{%ace edit=true, lang='c_cpp'%}
// This is a hello world program for C.
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
  printf("Hello World!");
  return 1;
}
{%endace%}
```

* ```edit```: if this is set to true, the code will be editable by the user.

* ```lang```: the language for syntax highlight. For the full list of keyword for each language, please check out the github page of ace [here](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/tree/master/src-min-noconflict), all the related files are starting with prefix ```mode-```. For instance:
    * mode_c_cpp.js ----> c_cpp
    * mode_java.js ----> java
    * ...

* '''check```: if this is set to false, syntax validation will be disabled.
